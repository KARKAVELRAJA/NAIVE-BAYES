# NAIVE-BAYES

### IMPLEMENTION OF NAIVE BAYES USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT SURVIVAL

- Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems
- It is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using NAIVE BAYES MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
